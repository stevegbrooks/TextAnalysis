There is a lot of concern lately about the nature of artificial intelligence.

Artificial intelligence isn't necessarily such a bad thing, however.  I don't believe it will really become a force for evil. 

Indeed, I think it will benefit our lives to a great extent. Of course, the change will necessarily bring about some negatives for some people, but overall I believe it will be a good thing.
